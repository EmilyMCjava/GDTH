                <p>Triggers are features in the Geometry Dash level editor used to manipulate surrounding objects in levels. 
                    All triggers other than the Start Position trigger are used in levels as an effect trigger. 
                    Triggers can be selected on the 12th tab, apart from the Area triggers, represented by the colour trigger in Update 2.1, 
                    formerly split up into other triggers.
                    While the feature of triggers has been existent since being introduced in Update 1.1, 
                    object triggers have been formally introduced in Update 2.0.

        <p>Move triggers are triggers that move certain groups of objects around in a level. To use this the player will have to know how to group objects under a specific group. <br>
            Once the player has given the group of objects a group ID, they may open the "Edit Object" menu while the move trigger is selected. The player will get a Move X input, 
            a Move Y input, 2 checkboxes labelled "Lock to player X/Y", an Easing option, a moving time, a target Group ID, and the touch-triggered and spawn-triggered checkboxes. <br>
            
            The Target Group ID controls which group of objects the player are currently going to be 
            moving. Set the number equal to the number of the group that the player want to move. <br>
            The player can then change the Move X and the Move Y to control the amount of movement 
            the group will move. <br>
            
            Putting a 10 into the X will move the group 1 grid square right.
            Putting a 1 in the X will not move the group 1 grid square right, but rather 1/10 of a grid square.
            If X is positive the group moves right. <br>
            If X is negative, the group will move left.<br>
            If Y is positive the group will move upwards, and if Y is negative, the group will move downwards.<br>
            The player can put a number in for both X and Y to make it move diagonally.<br>
            The slider allows movement from -100 to 100, but the actual range is -9999 to 99999, 
            as the player can input 5-digit integers outside that range.<br>
            The "Lock to Player X/Y" checkboxes will ignore the number inputted above them and will 
            instead move the group perfectly to any move the player makes. It will look like the object 
            is moving at the same speed of the player, or is just not moving at all depending on how 
            much of the level the player see. Applying two locking to player X's will make the objects 
            move twice the speed of the player. If enough objects are in the group and are used correctly, <br>
            it can make it seem like the player is moving backwards through the level.<br>
            
            The easing controls the distribution of movement across time. Some are easy to understand, 
            such as “bounce”, but others are not as straightforward and if used creatively can achieve 
            special effects (for example, the sine easing allows circular motion of objects).<br>
            
            The move time controls how long it will take to complete the movement. <br>
            As soon as that much time has elapsed, the group will be at the target destination and will stop moving, <br>
            unless there is another move trigger. Similar to colour triggers, the time range is from 0.00s 
            to 10.00s and can be set for more than that manually.<br>
            
            Triggers and speed portals can only be moved vertically. <br>
            Form portals' grids will not move with the portals, 
            making it possible to make an offset of the grid.<br>
            
            This trigger appears as magenta in the level editor.</p>

            <h4 id="ST">Stop Trigger:</h4>
        <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/3/32/StopTrigger.png/revision/latest?cb=20171206212441" alt="stop Trigger" width="129">

        <p>The stop trigger terminates the functions of all triggers within a selected group. To do this, the player must input the group ID of a trigger they wish to stop in the text box labelled "Group ID," and place the trigger in a convenient location.
            This trigger incorporates the Spawn-Triggered and Touch-Triggered options and appears as burgundy in the level editor.</p>

            <h4 id="PT">Pulse Trigger:</h4>
            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/5/56/PulseTrigger.png/revision/latest?cb=20160814073240" alt="pulse Trigger" width="129">
            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/7/73/PulseTriggerSetupMenuA.png/revision/latest?cb=20170519051705" alt="pulse trigger menu" width="129">
            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/6/64/PulseTriggerSetupMenuB.png/revision/latest?cb=20170519051728" alt="stop trigger setup menu" width="129">
            <p>Pulse Triggers will change a colour channel or group to one colour temporarily.
                In the bottom-right of the screen, there should be a field marked "Channel ID". Right above it are two buttons, one labelled "Channel" and one labelled "Group". The channel button will cause all objects using or copying the specified channel to pulse, while the group button will do the same except it will affect all objects using a group.
                
                Above those two are two more buttons, one reading "Color" and the other "HSV". Colour should be automatically selected and will cause the colour wheel to appear. A colour may be chosen from there to cause the specified group/channel to pulse the chosen colour. The HSV is for selecting colours similar to another and will change when the source colour is changed.
                
                Below the HSV options/colour wheel, there are three sliders, one "Fade-In," one "Hold," and one "Fade-Out." These are self-explanatory; the values in the fields should match the time in seconds the colour should fade in, stay, and fade out respectively.
                
                Similar to Colour Triggers, there are two buttons labelled Copy and Paste in the top-right, both serving the same function.
                
                This trigger appears as yellow in the level editor.</p>

                <h4 id="AT">Alpha Trigger:</h4>
            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/f/f5/AlphaTrigger.png/revision/latest?cb=20160814073240" alt="alpha Trigger" width="129">
            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/e/e2/AlphaTriggerSetupMenu.png/revision/latest?cb=20170519044456" alt="alpha trigger menu" width="129">
            <p>Alpha triggers are triggers that affect the transparency of a group of objects. Under the Group ID field, there are two sliders: FadeTime and Opacity. FadeTime is the time in seconds it should take for the specified group to reach the opacity selected using the Opacity slider.
                This trigger appears as cyan in the level editor.</p>

                <h4 id="TT">Toggle Trigger:</h4>
            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/0/0b/ToggleTrigger.png/revision/latest?cb=20170708024110" alt="toggle Trigger" width="129">
            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/e/ef/ToggleTriggerSetupMenu.png/revision/latest?cb=20170519052334" alt="toggle trigger menu" width="129">
            <p>Toggle triggers completely (de)activate a group of objects. If the tick box "Activate Group" is left unticked, the group will immediately disappear when passing by the trigger and the player can go through any platforms or obstacles in this particular group. If it is ticked, then the opposite will happen: the group will reappear and the player will not be able to pass through the hazards and static objects.
                Note that toggle triggers can take on two different colours in the editor depending on whether they are set to on or off. When it activates a group, it appears green. When it deactivates a group, it appears red. In the editor, it appears as default red.</p>
    
                <h4 id="ST2">Spawn Trigger:</h4>
                <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/b/bc/SpawnTrigger.png/revision/latest?cb=20160814073241" alt="spawn Trigger" width="129">
                <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/1/18/SpawnTriggerSetupMenu.png/revision/latest?cb=20170519051830" alt="spawn trigger menu" width="129">
                <p>Spawn triggers activate a certain group of triggers that are marked "Spawn Triggered". When activated, the group to be activated will be triggered at the same time, regardless of horizontal placement. In Update 2.1 the trigger was updated with an option to delay the group's activation with a slider. By default, the triggers activated by a spawn trigger can only be triggered once, even if the player passes by multiple spawn triggers activating the same triggers. This can be changed by checking the "Multi Activate" box in the triggers being spawn triggered.
                    This trigger appears as teal in the level editor.</p>
    
                    <h4 id="RT">Rotate Trigger:</h4>
                    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/b/b5/RotateTrigger.png/revision/latest?cb=20171206212442" alt="rotate Trigger" width="129">
                    <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/geometry-dash/images/4/42/RotateTriggerSetupMenu.png/revision/latest?cb=20170519051735" alt="rotate trigger menu" width="129">
                    <p>Rotation triggers allow the player to rotate objects within levels. In this trigger's edit menu, there is a degrees slider, a Times 360 slider, 3 checkboxes labelled "Target Group ID," "Center Group ID," and "Lock Object Rotation," an easing option, a moving time, and the touch-triggered and spawn-triggered checkboxes.
                        The target group is the group of objects that are to be rotated; the center group is the object the target group will rotate around. As stated in this trigger's help text, only one object can be in the center group.
                        
                        The number of degrees the target group will rotate is circumscribed by the "degrees" slider, and the "Times 360" slider defines how many times the objects will rotate by 360 degrees alongside the amount determined by the "degrees" slider.
                        
                        Selecting "Lock object rotation" will keep the objects in their original position upon and throughout their rotation. Not selecting this will result in the rotation of the objects within the target group around their own axises, corresponding with the degrees each object rotates around the center group.
                        
                        The move time controls how long it will take to complete the movement. As soon as that much time has elapsed, the group will be at the target destination and will stop moving, unless there is another rotation trigger. Similar to move triggers, the time range is from 0.00s to 10.00s and can be set for more than that manually. The easing controls the distribution of movement across time. Some are easy to understand, such as “bounce”, but others are not as straightforward and if used creatively can achieve special effects.

                        <p>The follow trigger allows specific objects to follow other objects that are being moved with the move trigger. This trigger's edit menu includes 3 sliders and 2 selectors: "X Mod," "Y Mod," "Move Time," & "Target Group ID," and "Follow Group ID."
                            The "target" group is the objects that will follow the specified "follow" group. The target group will only follow the "follow" group if the objects therein are moving.
                            
                            The X-modification and Y-modification sliders define how abnormal the target destination will be in reference to the follow group's destination. Setting 1 as the X or Y-Mod will result in a complete movement to the X or Y-position the follow group is at. Therefore, the numbers are based on percentages: -1 would be a -100%, or exact opposite, movement; 0.5 would be a 50%, or half-finished, movement, and so forth. The X and Y-Mod ranges are from -1 to 1, but it can be set for more than manually.
                            
                            The move time controls how long it will take to complete the movement. As soon as that much time has elapsed, the group will stop moving, regardless of whether it is at the target destination or not, unless there is another follow trigger. Similar to colour, move and rotation triggers, the time range is from 0.00s to 10.00s and can be set for more than that manually.

                            <p>This trigger grants the manipulation of animations' movements. In this trigger's edit menu, there are 2 selectors: "Group ID" and "Animation ID." The Group ID is the animation(s) that the player wants to animate (this trigger does not work on non-animated objects). Animation IDs are numbers assigned to specific animated object's movements; editing this changes said an animated object's movement. Below is a list of animation IDs for each animated object. <br>

                                3 = The bat appears angry for approximately 1 second.<br>
                                4 = The bat spits a fireball.<br>
                                5 = The bat opens its mouth and keeps it open.<br>
                                6 = The bat closes its mouth (Continuation of the above).<br>
                                7 = The bat stops flying and falls asleep.<br>
                                8 = The bat's sleeping animation on loop.<br>
                                9 = The bat wakes up (Continuation of the above).<br><br>
                                Monster: <br>

                                    <p>This trigger is a variation of the Follow Trigger; it allows selected objects to follow the player in the Y-axis. In this trigger's edit menu, there are 3 sliders, 2 input boxes, and 1 selector: "Speed," "Delay," "MoveTime," "Offset," "Max Speed," "Target Group ID,".
                                        The Speed slider is the multiplier of the target group's velocity when following the Player's Y axis position, the max being the player's Y velocity.
                                        
                                        The Delay slider controls how much time it should pass before the target group goes to the Player's Y-Axis current position.
                                        
                                        The "Move time" slider is how long the function should take effect.
                                        
                                        The "Offset" input box tells what position the target group should be (Positive number being above the player, negative being below)

                                        <p>The touch trigger may be configured to make tapping/holding the screen (or the mouse) (de)activate a group of objects. In this triggers edit menu, there is 1 selector and 4 tick boxes: "Group ID," "Dual Mode," "Hold Mode," "Toggle On," & "Toggle Off."
                                            If the "Dual Mode" tick box is left unticked, the trigger works for both of the icons if the player is in dual mode. If it is not, the trigger only works with the original icon.
                                            
                                            If the player checks the tick box labelled "Hold Mode," the trigger functions as long as the player is holding down on their mouse, screen, or spacebar, and the player's icon is past the trigger or within it (if the touch-triggered tick box is ticked).
                                            
                                            "Toggle On" and "Toggle Off" determines whether or not holding/tapping/clicking will toggle the specified group on or off. If left unchecked, continued tapping will cycle between toggle on and off. In "Hold Mode", holding will toggle on and releasing will toggle off, but if "Toggle On" is selected, the actions are reversed.

                                            <p>Count triggers are used to trigger actions after the player has collected a specific amount of items. In this trigger's edit menu, there are 3 selectors and 2 tickboxes: "Item ID," "Target ID," "Target Count," and "Activate Group," and "Multi Activate."
                                                The target group is the group that is to be (de)activated; the item group is the group of items that are deemed the collectables; the target count is the amount of items needed to (de)activate the target group.
                                                
                                                The player may select whether or not achieving the target count deactivates or activates the target group with the "Activate Group" tick box (ticked = activates; unticked = deactivates).

This trigger's edit menu is almost identical to that of the Count Trigger's, there are 3 selectors and 4 tick boxes: "Item ID," "Target ID," "Target Count," and "Activate Group," "Equals," "Larger," & "Smaller."
                        The target group is the group that is to be (de)activated; the item group is the group of items that are deemed the collectables; the target count is the number of items that determines when the target group will be (de)activated.
                        <br>
                        The tick boxes, "Equals," "Larger," and "Smaller", determine when the target group will be (de)activated.<br>
                        
                        If "equals" is selected, the player must achieve the exact target count to (de)activate the target group.<br>
                        If "larger" is selected, the player must gain more objects than the target count to (de)activate the target group.<br>
                        If "smaller" is selected, the target group will be (de)activated until the player reaches the target goal or gains more than thereof.<br>
                        The player may select whether or not achieving the target count deactivates or activates the target group with the "Activate Group" tick box (ticked = activates; unticked = deactivates).<br>

                    <p>The collision trigger sets off an action upon two selected collision block's encounter. It uses a special block called "Collision block"
                        The player is to assign IDs to 2 blocks (block A/B), which are the blocks that are to collide. Keep in note that one of the said blocks must have the "Dynamic Block" box checked in order to work.
                        
                        The player may determine whether block A and B's collision shall make the target objects activate or deactivate. The player must also input the "Target ID," which is the Group ID of the object(s) the player wishes to (de)activate.
                        
                        If the "Trigger On Exit" tick box is checked, the trigger will function when both blocks were but are no longer within each other's hitbox.
                        
                        When the trigger functions, the target group will be (de)activated, and it will work as a Spawn trigger to the same group; every "Spawn-Triggered" trigger in the group will be activated (if the player chose to activate the target group).

            <h2 id="functionalitytriggerimportant"><strong>Why do we need triggers and why are they important?<strong></h2>
            
            

            <h4>In Geometry Dash, triggers play a crucial role in creating interactive and 
                dynamic gameplay experiences. Triggers are special objects or entities that 
                can be used to activate various events within the level. They are essential 
                for adding complexity, challenges, and interactivity to the game. Here's why 
                triggers are needed and important in Geometry Dash: <br><br>

                Gameplay Variation: Triggers allow level creators to introduce a 
                wide variety of gameplay mechanics. They can control moving platforms, 
                rotating objects, changing gravity, altering player speed, and more. 
                By utilizing triggers, each level can offer a unique and engaging experience,
                keeping players entertained and challenged.<br><br>
                
                Level Progression: Triggers are essential for advancing the player through the level. 
                When a player reaches a specific point, a trigger can activate doors, portals, 
                or other mechanisms that lead to the next section of the level. 
                This ensures a seamless and coherent gameplay experience.<br><br>
                
                Interactive Elements: Triggers enable interactive elements in the level. 
                For example, by using a trigger, a creator can make objects appear or disappear, 
                create explosions, or trigger special effects that respond to the player's actions. 
                These interactive elements make the level more engaging and immersive.<br><br>
                
                Difficulty Control: Triggers are crucial for adjusting the level's difficulty. 
                Creators can use triggers to change the speed, size, or frequency of obstacles, 
                making the level easier or more challenging. This level of control ensures that 
                players of all skill levels can enjoy the game.<br><br>
                
                Rhythm and Synchronization: In a rhythm-based game like Geometry Dash, 
                triggers are vital for synchronizing the gameplay with the music. 
                Creators can use triggers to time the appearance of obstacles, jumps, 
                and other elements to match the beat and rhythm of the music, 
                creating a satisfying and immersive experience for players.<br><br>
                
                Puzzles and Secrets: Triggers can be used to hide secret passages, 
                unlock hidden areas, or create puzzle-like challenges within the level. 
                This adds an element of exploration and discovery for players, 
                encouraging them to explore the level thoroughly.<br><br>
                
                Visual and Aesthetic Effects: Triggers can also be used to trigger visual effects, 
                such as color changes, screen shakes, or screen flashes. These effects add visual 
                interest and excitement to the level, enhancing the overall player experience.<br><br>
                
                In summary, triggers are essential in Geometry Dash because 
                they provide level creators with the tools to design complex and 
                interactive levels. They allow for gameplay variation, level progression, 
                interactive elements, difficulty control, rhythm synchronization, puzzles, 
                secrets, and visual effects. Without triggers, the game would lack the depth and 
                creativity that makes it so enjoyable and popular among players and creators alike.<br><br></h4>
